				<section>Beyond<br>Math.random( )
					<aside class='notes'>
						I'm going to talk about random numbers: Where they are useful, where they break down, and what other useful and similar things can stand in for them.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section><p style='text-decoration: underline;'>very useful for</p>
						making passwords<br>
						shuffling arrays
					<aside class='notes'>
						<p>if you flip a coin 1000 times and it is heads 1000 times, what are the odds it is heads on the 1001th flip? 50%.  The coin doesn't care about the previous flips.</p>
						<p>when you make a password you want each byte to be independent of the previous byte</p>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p style='text-decoration: underline;'>extra useful for</p>
					when you can't even
					<aside class='notes'>
						<p>If you have a big grid of things and you just can't get to everything, you can sample your problem space randomly and that is good enough.</p>
					</aside>

				<section>
					just look at<br>a random sample
					<aside class='notes'>
						<p>If you want to calculate the brightness of an image, just look at 10% of the pixels and do the math with them.  You see this in a lot of places like opinion polling.</p>

						<p>It also lets you simulate stuff because some stuff is seemingly random.</p>

					<a href='https://donutjs.club'>sprinkle distribution is seemingly random</a>
					<aside class='notes'>
						<p>the donutjs website uses math.random to place sprinkles</p>
						<p>they do that because they didn't want to have to decide where they should fall, and store that and transmit it to you, saving time and money</p>
						<p>but there are other approaches beyond math.random</p>
						<p>and because javascript is fantastic I can just show you</p>
						<p>they also added random velocities to the particles in the last 24hrs</p>
						<code>
// you don't want to just have the sprinkles fall in one spot
Math.random = function (){
 return 0.25
}
// you can use the sine function where you pass the time in as an argument and get a value between zero and one
Math.random = function (){
 return Math.abs(Math.sin(Date.now()*0.0001))
}
// you can even tune the frequency of the shift left and right by increasing the size of the multiplier
Math.random = function (){
 return Math.abs(Math.sin(Date.now()*0.001))
}
// you can combine multiple sine/cosine operations to get a more complex waveform
Math.random = function (){
 return Math.abs(Math.sin(Date.now()*0.0001) * Math.cos(Date.now()*0.0001))
}
// which you can also tune the frequencies of
Math.random = function (){
 return Math.abs(Math.sin(Date.now()*0.0001) * Math.cos(Date.now()*0.001))
}
// this one is pretty good, I like the bunching
Math.random = function (){
 return Math.abs(Math.sin(Date.now()*0.0001) * Math.cos(Date.now()*0.01))
}

				<section data-background-image='img/random-grid.png'>
					<p>Math.random( )</p>
					<p>no zoom<br>not repeatable<br>no shift<br>stuff isn't really random
					<aside class='notes'>
						Math.random is good enough.  It's better than choosing a pattern and storing some state - you can call Math.random and get a number.  It has limitations though: you can't zoom, you can't always get the same random numbers, you can't shift the frame, and things aren't actually random they just appear random

				<section data-background-image='img/teiltoene_bild3.png'>
					<p>Math.sin(time)</p>
					<p>zoomable<br>repeatable<br>1D shift<br>stuff is kinda sinusoidal<br>
					<aside class='notes'>
						one step better than math.random is a sufficiently complex set of trig functions all blended together.  you can zoom in, you can repeat the sequence, you can shift the sequency, sine waves are all over nature
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-background-image='img/PerlinNoiseFractal.png'>
					<p>Noise(x, y, time)</p>
					<aside class='notes'>
						A step or two beyond trig functions lies the idea of something called calculated noise. Noise is what was used to generate this.  It already looks like so many things, and that's what it was designed to do.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-background-image='img/marblewaterrabbit.jpg'>
					<p>realism</p>
					<aside class='notes'>
 						Noise was invented by a computer graphics artist in the mid 80s who wanted to improve the realism of renders.  The code is not simple and I don't claim to understand it well enough to explain.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>Math.random</p>
					<img src='img/math.random.png' style='width: 100%;'>
					<aside class='notes'>
						This is the code for math.random.  3 lines.  It has two state variables that get mixed and shifted around at the bit level.  It fits on a slide you can read.
					</aside>

						This is the code for noise.  It's 5 pages with comments. The code is in the repo.

					demos!<br>
					<a href='https://github.com/billautomata/donutjs_talk/tree/master/js'>link to code</a>
					<aside class='notes'>
						enough unreadable slides, let's do demos
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<a href='cubes.html'>box thing</a>
					<aside class='notes'>
						this is a visualizaton of noise in 2D,
						I feed in the xy position of the box and I get a size
						in a 2d view like this you can use time as the 3rd input variable

						you can zoom
						you can shift
						you change the level of detail and the steepness of the gradient

						you can also compress the dimensions
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-background-image='img/vector-field.png'>
					<a href='particles.html'>particle system<br>vector field</a>
					<aside class='notes'>
						this is a set of particle systems where it's attracted to a center point, but it also flows through a vector field built with noise.  So when a particle flies through that (x,y) position it will be influenced in the same direction.  The green particles have the same thing happen but every tick of the simulation the velocity is bumped around randomly.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-background-video='img/test.mp4'>
					<a href='terrain-generator.html'><p style='margin-top: 500px;'>terrain generator</p></a>
					<aside class='notes'>
						This is from star trek 2, this is one of the first particle systems in a movie and it's also likely the first use of noise in computer graphics generation.  It utilized all the things we showed in the box demo.  They needed the algorithm to be repeatable - when the planet height for that position was chosen it needed to be the same on each run, otherwise the camera would fly through a mountain or the ocean wouldn't rise high enough.  They also couldn't store all this information and retrieve it every time they wanted to make a frame.

						this is the same demo as the boxes except I set the height of a mesh from the returned noise value
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<a href='rolling-waves.html'>waves thing</a>
					<aside class='notes'>
						Here is a thing that kind of emulates waves rolling in from the ocean.  You compress the y axis sample multiplier, then make the waves the right height relative to their period and tune the time, then have them roll in by increasing the sample offset in the y dimension - so if you had surf.js or ocean.js you could have this be your sprinkles
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<a href='rock-thing.html'>rock thing</a>
					<aside class='notes'>
						You can apply noise to more than just flat heightmaps.  A sphere is just a heightmap where the radius is the height of the terrain.  I'm actually doing two passes on the rock, one where I sample the noise zoomed in pretty far and use that to set the overall shape, then I zoom out and apply the noise in a detail.

				<section data-background-image='img/wildflowers.jpg' style='color: white;'>
					@wildflowersbot<br>
					<a href='scene.html'>scene</a>
					<aside class='notes'>
						I really like this bot called wildflowersbot.  It posts photos.  I'd like to do my own version that is a little pacific northwesty with a rock and some trees and some rolling hills.
