						<p>if you flip a coin 1000 times and it is heads 1000 times, what are the odds it is heads on the 1001th flip? 50%.  The coin doesn't care about the previous flips.</p>
						<p>when you make a password you want each byte to be independent of the previous byte</p>

					<a href='https://donutjs.club'>sprinkle distribution is seemingly random</a>
					<aside class='notes'>
						<p>the donutjs website uses math.random to place sprinkles</p>
						<p>they do that because they didn't want to have to decide where they should fall, and store that and transmit it to you, saving time and money</p>
						<p>but there are other approaches beyond math.random</p>
						<p>and because javascript is fantastic I can just show you</p>
						<code>
// you don't want to just have the sprinkles fall in one spot
Math.random = function (){
 return 0.25
}
// you can use the sine function where you pass the time in as an argument and get a value between zero and one
Math.random = function (){
 return Math.abs(Math.sin(Date.now()*0.0001))
}
// you can even tune the frequency of the shift left and right by increasing the size of the multiplier
Math.random = function (){
 return Math.abs(Math.sin(Date.now()*0.001))
}
// you can combine multiple sine/cosine operations to get a more complex waveform
Math.random = function (){
 return Math.abs(Math.sin(Date.now()*0.0001) * Math.cos(Date.now()*0.0001))
}
// which you can also tune the frequencies of
Math.random = function (){
 return Math.abs(Math.sin(Date.now()*0.0001) * Math.cos(Date.now()*0.001))
}
// this one is pretty good, I like the bunching
Math.random = function (){
 return Math.abs(Math.sin(Date.now()*0.0001) * Math.cos(Date.now()*0.01))
}

					<p>Noise</p>
					<aside class='notes'>
						Noise is what was used to generate this.  It already looks like so many things, and that's what it was designed to do.

 						Noise was invented by a computer graphics artist who wanted to improve the realism of renders.

					<img src='img/math.random.png' style='width: 100%;'>
					<aside class='notes'>
						This is the code for math.random.  It has two state variables that get mixed and shifted around at the bit level.

				<section data-background-image='img/vector-field.png'>
					particle system<br>vector field
					<aside class='notes'>
						this is a set of particle systems where it's attracted to a center point, but it also flows through a vector field built with noise.  So when a particle flies through that (x,y) position it will be influenced in the same direction.  The green particles have the same thing happen but every tick of the simulation the velocity is bumped around randomly.

				<section data-background-video='img/test.mp4'>
					<p style='color:white; margin-top: 500px;'>terrain generator</p>
					<aside class='notes'>
						This is from star trek 2, this is one of the first particle systems in a movie and it's also likely the first use of noise in computer generation.  It utilized all the things we showed in the box demo.  They needed the algorithm to be repeatable - when the planet height for that position was chosen it needed to be the same on each run, otherwise the camera would fly through a mountain or the ocean wouldn't rise high enough.  They also couldn't store all this information and retrieve it every time they wanted to make a frame.

				<section>
					waves thing
					<aside class='notes'>
						Here is a thing that kind of emulates waves rolling in from the ocean.  You compress the y axis sample multiplier, then make the waves the right height relative to their period and tune the time, then have them roll in by setting the speed of the sample offset in the y dimension

						You can do this to more than just heightmaps.  A sphere is just a heightmap where the radius is the height of the terrain.
